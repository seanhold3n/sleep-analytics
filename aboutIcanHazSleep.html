		the amount of sleep you get per day. Awesome, right?! We thought so. </p>

		The first file needed is the <em> sleep data file </em>. This file is needed so the cats can assess the patterns of your sleep. <br /> 
		This file needs to be in CSV format. You can follow the following format in Excel and export to CSV. </p>
